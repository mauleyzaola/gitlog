# Gitlog

Simple parsing of git repositories and get instant metrics in different formats.

The idea behind this project is make easy data transformation of the contents of git files, into more workable information.

So far, we are only focusing to output plain text without UI. This can change in the future.

Data output can come out in different formats such as JSON, DB Engines, XML and so forth.
